# Lineman

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/testdouble/lineman.png)](http://travis-ci.org/testdouble/lineman)

Lineman is a tool to help you build fat-client webapp projects. It requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org) & [npm](http://npmjs.org) and wouldn't be possible without [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

For an overview, consider checking out the [demo screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmZ4XRErYAI)!

## Why Lineman?

Suppose that you're starting a new [single page web application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) and you want to reap the benefits of loose coupling between your client-side and server side. If that rings true, then Lineman (and similar tools) can help to keep you as productive working in the front-end as [traditional HTML generation frameworks](http://rubyonrails.org) do on the back-end.

Now, for the features!

Lineman is a *productivity* tool, in that it provides a development server which:

* Serves up your app on a [local development server](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman#development) at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* Compiles your [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) into JavaScript as soon as you save a file
* Immediately compiles your [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Less](http://lesscss.org) into CSS
* Provides [tools to stub out your back-end API services](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman#stubbing-server-side-endpoints) with [express](http://expressjs.com)
* Compiles your JavaScript templates (e.g. Underscore, Handlebars) to a `window.JST` object that maps their file path to the compiled template function
* Can ease development by [proxying XHRs to your server-side app](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman#proxying-requests-to-another-server)
* [Features a *delightful* spec runner](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman#specs) called [Testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem), which comes pre-configured for Jasmine

Lineman is also a *build* tool, because when you're ready to deploy:

* You can [deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman#heroku) just by committing and pushing with git
* Assemble your app into a [ready-to-deploy `dist` directory](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman#static-assets)
* Run your specs headlessly for a [continuous integration build](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman#continuous-integration-specs)

At the end of the day, Lineman is just a handful of conventions and grunt task configurations that can help you get up-and-running more quickly than rolling your own. It's easy to extend and modify as your application grows.

## Getting started

First, you'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org). If you plan on running tests, you'll also want [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) somewhere on your PATH. (This is where [the aforementioned screencast picks up](http://searls.testdouble.com/2012/10/13/say-hello-to-lineman/).)

Next, you'll need to install Lineman globally:

``` bash
$ npm install -g lineman
```

Once Lineman is installed, you can either ask it to generate a new project for you, or you might consider cloning from a pre-existing template.

### lineman new

To create a new project, run the `lineman` binary with the `new` command and tell it where you'd like the project to go:

``` bash
$ lineman new my-project
```

This will create a new directory named "my-project" and copy in Lineman's [archetypal project](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman/tree/master/archetype).

### Starting from a template

We have a few template projects floating around to help you get up-and-running *even more faster*.

* Using [Backbone.js](https://github.com/davemo/lineman-backbone-template)
* Using [Angular.js](https://github.com/davemo/lineman-angular-template)
* Using [Ember.js](https://github.com/searls/lineman-ember-template)
* Creating a [JavaScript library](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman-lib-template)
* Building a [Markdown blog](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman-blog)

## Working with Lineman

### Development

To see all of the options available to you in the terminal use the `-h` or `--help` option:

``` bash
$ lineman --help
```

From the project directory, you can start a server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

``` bash
$ lineman run
```

Internally, Grunt's `watch` task will monitor for file changes; in turn, Lineman's default configuration will fire the appropriate tasks when a file of a given type is saved.

With any luck, visiting the server in your browser will yield something as *beautiful* as this:

![Development Screenshot](http://i.minus.com/i1vI8cdB0tRPK.png)

The Hello World code shows off JST compilation, CoffeeScript, and Less. When you edit a source file, your changes are usually reflected by the time you can refresh your browser.

#### Server-side APIs

Lineman has a very narrow focus: helping you build client-side apps as a collection of ready-to-deploy static assets. That said, almost all nontrivial client-side apps require some interaction with a server, and no developer could be expected to write working code without either faking the server-side or plugging the client and server together. Lineman offers support for both!

##### Stubbing server-side endpoints

Users may define custom HTTP services to aid development in `config/server.js` by exporting a function named `drawRoutes`. Here's a trivial example:

``` javascript
module.exports = {
  drawRoutes: function(app) {
    app.get('/api/greeting/:message', function(req, res){
      res.json({ message: "OK, "+req.params.message });
    });
  }
};
```

With this definition in place, if the client-side app makes a request to "/api/greeting/ahoy!", this route will handle the request and return some JSON.

Because Lineman uses [express](http://expressjs.com) for the development server, please reference its documentation for details on all the nifty things you can do.

#### Proxying requests to another server

Lineman also provides a facility to forward any requests that it doesn't know how to respond to a proxy service. Typically, if you're developing a client-side app in Lineman and intend to pair it to a server-side app (written, say, in Ruby on Rails), you could run a local Rails server on port 3000 while running Lineman, and your JavaScript could seamlessly send requests to Rails on the same port as Lineman's development server.

To enable proxying, set the `enabled` flag on the `apiProxy` configuration of the `server` task in `config/application.js`, like this:

``` javascript
  server: {
    apiProxy: {
      enabled: true,
      port: 3000
    }
  }
```

With this feature, you'll be able to develop your client-side and server-side code in concert, while still keeping the codebases cleanly separated.

#### HTML5 pushState Simulation

Lineman provides a way to direct requests to either the `apiProxy` or serve up `generated/index.html` in order to simulate what using HTML5 pushState will behave like when running in dev mode. This requires both `apiProxy.prefix` and `server.pushState` configuration property to be set, so that the `apiProxy` correctly knows how route requests to the api you have configured. To enable `pushState` in your application set the `pushState` flag on the `server` task in `config/application.js` _and_ the `prefix` on the `apiProxy` configuration of the `server` task, like this:

``` javascript
  server: {
    // enables HTML5 pushState; Lineman will correctly serve `generated/index.html` for any request that does not match the apiProxy.prefix
    pushState: true,
    apiProxy: {
      enabled: true,
      port: 3000,
      prefix: 'api' // any requests that contain 'api' will now be the only ones forwarded to the apiProxy
    }
  }
```

**Note:** enabling `server.pushState` merely configures the `apiProxy` to be smart about routing, you will still need to configure pushState support in whichever client-side routing library you are using.

### Specs

Lineman provides a way to run your specs constantly as you work on your code with the `lineman spec` command:

``` bash
$ lineman spec
```

**Heads up!** `lineman spec` only runs your tests, so be sure to keep `lineman run` running in another process (e.g. an extra terminal tab) to continue to monitor file changes.

The `spec` command will launch the fantastic test framework [Testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) supports Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, PhantomJS and (IE9, IE8, IE7 if on Windows). By default we have configured Testem to launch Chrome for tests during development.

You can override this by modifying the `launch_in_dev` property within `config/spec.json`

We have found that running tests in Chrome during development is ideal as it enables the insertion of `debugger;` statements into javascript which allows debugging in the browser.

##### Growl/Growl-ish notification

You can also enable testem [Growl/Growl-ish notification](https://github.com/airportyh/testem#growl-or-growl-ish-notifications) so you don't have to look at terminal while developing.
To enable this feature, set the `growl` flag on the `options` property of the `spec` task in `config/application.js`, like this:

``` javascript
  spec: {
    options: {
      growl: true
    }
  }
```

### Continuous Integration Specs

You can also run specs with output generated for your CI environment in [TAP 13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) format:

``` bash
$ lineman spec-ci
```

This configuration executes specs headlessly using only PhantomJS. You can override this by modifying the `launch_in_ci` property within `config/spec.json`

### Production

When you're ready to send your application off to a remote server, just run the `lineman build` task.

``` bash
$ lineman build
```

The above runs a task that produces a production-ready web application in the project's `dist/` directory.

### Cleaning

To clean the two build directories (`dist` and `generated`), just run the clean task:

``` bash
$ lineman clean
```

## Project directory structure

Lineman generates a very particular directory structure. It looks like this:

``` bash
.
├── app
│   ├── js                  # <-- JS & CoffeeScript
│   ├── img                 # <-- images (are merged into the 'img' folder inside of generated & dist)
│   └── pages               # <-- static HTML pages (underscore and handlebars templates are supported)
│       └── index.us        # <-- a template used to produce the application's index.html
│   └── templates           # <-- client-side templates
│       ├── other.us        # <-- other templates will be compiled to a window.JST object
│       └── thing.hb        # <-- underscore & handlebars are both already set up
│       └── _partial.hb     # <-- a handlebars partial, usable from within other handlebars templates
├── config
│   ├── application.js      # <-- Override application configuration
│   ├── files.js            # <-- Override named file patterns
│   ├── server.js           # <-- Define custom server-side endpoints to aid in development
│   └── spec.json           # <-- Override spec run configurations
├── dist                    # <-- Generated, production-ready app assets
├── generated               # <-- Generated, pre-production app assets
├── grunt.js                # <-- gruntfile defines app's task config
├── package.json            # <-- Project's package.json
├── tasks                   # <-- Custom grunt tasks can be defined here
├── spec
│   ├── helpers             # <-- Spec helpers (loaded before other specs)
│   └── some-spec.coffee    # <-- All the Jasmine specs you can write (JS or Coffee)
└── vendor                  # <-- 3rd-party assets will be prepended or merged into the application
    ├── js                  # <-- 3rd-party Javascript
    │   └── underscore.js   # <-- Underscore, because underscore is fantastic.
    ├── img                 # <-- 3rd-party images (are merged into the 'img' folder inside of generated & dist)
    └── css                 # <-- 3rd-party CSS

```

## Custom Tasks

Lineman can easily be extended to do extra grunt-work for your application above-and-beyond the built-in grunt tasks. You may add tasks to your project in two ways:

* If you're writing a task yourself, add it to the `tasks/` directory. Lineman will automatically load any tasks found here.
* If you want to use a task that's packaged in an external npm module, add it to your `package.json` as a dependency and run `npm install`.

Once they're loaded, you can manually run the task from the command line using `lineman grunt` (which just delegates through to `grunt`):

```bash
$ lineman grunt taskname
```

But you're probably more interested in adding the custom task to run along with the other tasks in `lineman run` and/or `lineman build`. You can add any task to these commands by adding it to the appropriate array under the `appendTasks` object in `config/application.js`:

```javascript
  prependTasks: {
    common: ["A"],
    dev: ["B"],
    dist: ["C"]
  },
  appendTasks: {
    common: ["D"],
    dev: ["E"],
    dist: ["F"]
  }
```

In the above example, tasks "A" & "D" would run during *both* `lineman run` and `lineman build`. Meanwhile, "B" & "E" would run only during `lineman run`, while "C" & "F" would only run during `lineman build`.

Tasks specified under `prependTasks` way will be run before Lineman's built-in tasks for the corresponding phase, while tasks specified under `appendTasks` will run immediately afterward. For reference, [check out](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman/blob/master/config/application.coffee#L11-L14) Lineman's default configuration.

If you need more fine-grained control—say you want to *replace or remove* a default task—you can use custom JavaScript in your application config file to edit the appropriate array directly; [here's an example of removing a task](https://github.com/searls/lineman-ember-template/blob/master/config/application.coffee#L10-L14) from the [Ember.js template](https://github.com/searls/lineman-ember-template).

#### Removing tasks

But that's not all! If you need to remove a task that's built into Lineman, you can use the "removeTasks" configuration. For example, if you wanted to disable Lineman's CoffeeScript task, you could do this:

```javascript
  removeTasks: {
    common: ["coffee"]
  }
```

### Adding NPM based tasks

To load NPM-based tasks that aren't part of the standard Lineman dependencies, you can add the module names to the `loadNpmTasks` object in `config/application.js`. Note that these still need to be added to your app's `package.json` dependencies and installed to `node_modules` with `npm install`.

```javascript
  loadNpmTasks: ["npm_task_to_load"]
```

### Adding Custom tasks

Lineman will automatically require all files in the `tasks` directory and load them into Grunt. If you have custom tasks, you
can leave them there and add them to the build as above.

### Using Sass

Lineman supports [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) via [grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass). Because the `sass` task requires Ruby & the "sass" gem to be installed in order to function, it is disabled by default.

First, to enable sass, in your `config/application.js` file, specify:

``` javascript
enableSass: true
```

Once Sass is enabled, it will look for a "main.scss" or "main.sass" file in `app/css`. Rather than concatenating all the source files you include in your project, Sass files will only be included as you `@import` them from your main file. For more information on overriding the options in grunt-contrib-sass, please check out its [README](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass).

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Open Files

The `lineman run` command keeps file handles on all your projects files at once. If you're seeing a message that looks like this:

    undefined: [Lundefined:Cundefined] EMFILE, too many open files

Or this

    Error: watch Unknown system errno 23

Then it probably means your project has gotten big enough to either run into the user limit on open file descriptors or (in the case of the latter), the hard limit on your operating system's file table .

To resolve this issue, we recommend first increasing the user limit on open files with the `ulimit` command. You might do this at the beginning of any terminal session or in your `~/.profile` dotfile.

    ulimit -n 2048

# Deployment

## Static assets

The great thing about a tool whose focus is narrowly on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is that's *all you have to worry about* when it comes time to deploy. When you're ready to deploy, just run:

```
$ lineman build
```

And this will place a version of your app with minified assets that's ready to be deployed wherever you like. Maybe you'll plan on integrating it with your server-side's existing deployment, or maybe you'll host the files on a static file server.

## Heroku

Deploying your app to [heroku](http://heroku.com) couldn't be easier. Once you have the [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com) installed, simply run this from your project:

```
heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack http://github.com/testdouble/heroku-buildpack-lineman.git
```

Now, whenever you `git push heroku`, our [custom buildpack](http://github.com/testdouble/heroku-buildpack-lineman) will build your project with lineman and then start serving your minified site assets with apache!

What's really neat about this workflow is that while heroku takes care of building the assets for you (meaning you don't have to worry about checking in or transferring any generated assets), at runtime node is nowhere to be found! Your site is just static assets running on apache.

# About

## the name

Lineman got its name from finding that the word "grunt" was first used to describe unskilled railroad workers. Grunts that made the cut were promoted to linemen.

## the motivation

Most fat-client web applications are still written as second-class denizens within server-side project directories. This has inhibited the formation of a coherent community of people who write applications HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because the server-side technology is dominant. Front-end work on a Rails project differs greatly from front-end work on a Java project, even though they're building the same thing!

All we wanted was a cozy & productive application development tool that didn't saddle our client-side code with a particular server-side technology. Intentionally dividing backend and front-end projects applies a healthy pressure to decouple the two.

It doesn't hurt that with Lineman, we're able to bootstrap new client-side apps faster than we ever have before.

## the terms

Lineman was created by [test double](http://testdouble.com), a software studio in Columbus, Ohio. It's distributed under the [MIT license](http://mit-license.org).

# Running Lineman's Tests

If you're interested in contributing to Lineman, it's probably worth knowing how to run Lineman's tests. It's a little tricky, because we're using Ruby & RSpec to integration-test a node project.

Once you've cloned lineman, here's all you need to install lineman's dependencies and the run its tests.

``` bash
$ npm install
$ cd test
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rspec
```
