# This thing is somewhat disgusting. Best that I use an example to explain:
#   Suppose the user enters "lineman clean run"
#   This means when the `clean` action runs, ARGV will look like this:
#     ["node", "/usr/.../lineman/cli.js", "clean", "run"]
#   Now, what we want to do is tell commander to run the `run` action next.
#   We can do that by sending commander.parse(["node", "/usr/...cli.js", "run"])
#   However, we also want to mutate process.argv (yuck) in the event that two
#   chainable commands are repeated. We also want to ensure that any arguments
#   passed to action A are not retained when we re-parse (or else they'll gum
#   up the works).
